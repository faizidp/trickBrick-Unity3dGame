# trickBrick-Unity3dGame
Tricky Brick is a not-completed-yet 2d Android Game... Actually this one is a clone of a game from Ketchapp Games. I uploaded this to GitHub as a reference for my newbies to unity Friends.....   Read the following passage to open it in Unity:

* I have not uploaded Whole Project because that would cost more data usage and currently i have limited package,
*  so i just uploaded the assets folder....
*  If u have been prior to Unity, perhaps u'd already know how to open the assets folder as Project other than follow me: 
                     *UnRar the Tricky Brick.rar file after downloading
                     *Create a new Project in Unity
                     * Paste the Assets folder of Tricky Brick.rar to Your newly created project folder... Overright if asked
                     * Enjoy :-)
